InversePower - Trying to fix GTA V's crappy car physics.
===========

InversePower tries to counteract the fact that GTA V cuts off power when your 
car starts gliding. This allows for a more realistic and less annoying driving 
experience. Drifting and slides are easier to maintain and adjust.

This mod is inspired by Drift Assist by InfamousSabre and works similarly. The
big difference is that speed is used as a negative feedback to make cars not
accelerate unrealistically and swerve out of control at higher speeds.

Building
====

You'll need [Script Hook V SDK](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/). Clone
this into the SDK root folder and things should work out.
