InversePower
===========

InversePower tries to counteract the fact that GTA V cuts off power when your 
car starts gliding. This allows for a more realistic and less annoying driving 
experience. Drifting and slides are easier to maintain and adjust.

This mod is inspired by Drift Assist by InfamousSabre and works similarly. The
big difference is that speed is used as a negative feedback to make cars not
accelerate unrealistically and swerve out of control at higher speeds.

## Building

Download the [ScriptHookV SDK](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) and extract it's contents to ScriptHookV_SDK. 
Clone this repository to the same folder ScriptHookV_SDK was extracted so you have ScriptHookV_SDK and GTAVManualTransmission in the same folder.
